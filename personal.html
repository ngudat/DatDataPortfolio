									<h1>BACKGROUND AND GOALS</h1>

								<h3 class="left">BACKGROUND</h3>
								<body>
									After completing high school, I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps with the desire to serve my country. I was particularly fascinated by aviation and regarded it as the pinnacle of military engineering.
									Fortunately, I had the opportunity to join the Marine aviation wing and undergo one year of technical training in Florida. Following my training, I was stationed in Okinawa, Japan, where I provided support to the Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron (MALS 36). 
									My responsibilities primarily involved working on diesel power generators and hydraulic power units (HPUs).
									After spending two years in Japan, I faced a choice between joining a new squadron start-up or supporting the Presidential Squadron (HM-1). Opting for the start-up appealed to me as it presented a greater challenge and the excitement of building an organization from scratch. 
									Remarkably, this squadron became one of the fastest deploying squadrons in history, ultimately deploying to Afghanistan within three years. Unfortunately, my service concluded a year before the deployment, preventing me from joining my friends on the front lines.
									</br>
									</br>
									Following my military service, my aspiration to become an engineer compelled me to enroll in college courses geared toward that goal. During my initial year in college, I grappled with the transition from the military to full-time schooling, recognizing that this arrangement was not sustainable. 
									Consequently, I took a step back and decided to seek a full-time job while taking a semester break. I consider myself fortunate to have found Enhanced Drilling and joined Chevron's joint venture R&D project called Dual Gradient Drilling.
									During this time, the project was still in its early development phase, and no products had been constructed yet. To contribute to the company's progress, I joined the Maximo Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) implementation team. 
									Maximo utilized Oracle's MySQL database to track assets, shipping, inventory, and maintenance. Initially, I was a member of the team, but as other team members became overwhelmed with additional project tasks, I assumed a leadership role. 
									I led a team consisting of two data analysts and one to two solutions architect contractors in successfully executing the CMMS implementation project. Simultaneously, I was working over 40 hours per week while attending night classes to pursue my engineering degree.
									My time at Enhanced Drilling was excellent until the oil and gas industry downturn resulted in the conclusion of my employment there.
									</br>
									</br>
									Confronted with the industry downturn, I recognized that the logical next step was to prioritize obtaining my engineering degree. From 2015 to 2018, I immersed myself in my studies, acquiring knowledge in engineering and eagerly exploring the world of engineering. 
									One of my most cherished courses involved coding, particularly "Intro to Programming for Engineering," where we utilized Matlab for engineering calculations and data visualization. I found great joy in Matlab, as it introduced me to a world of automation. 
									At that time, I believed this was the epitome of engineering, and my enthusiasm knew no bounds. Throughout my college experience, whenever a course provided an opportunity to apply Matlab, I jumped to the opportunity. Despite my classmates' disdain for Matlab, opting for 
									Excel instead, I relished coding for data analysis and visualization in classes such as "Experimental Methods" or developing a "Finite Element Analysis" algorithm capable of performing FEA on elements subjected to linear and non-linear force distributions and point loads at various angles. 
									Upon graduating, I was very overwhelmed, since my parents are immigrants without an education, who could not afford to send their only child to school. 
									</br>
									</br>
									Shortly after graduation, I was fortunate to secure a position at Wood Group as a Design Analyst, utilizing proprietary software to analyze forces resulting from pulsation and vibrations in large gas compressors, piping, vessels, and scrubbers. 
									This role exposed me to various facets of project management, pulsation and vibration analysis, and compressor forces. Within less than a year, I surpassed the company's key performance indicators for analysts and generated additional revenue. However, I encountered a repetitive task that became particularly time-consuming during iterations. 
									Recognizing this challenge, I took the initiative to learn VBA and developed a tool to automate the process. This tool streamlined the task, reducing it from days to minutes, and I collaborated with a senior engineer to review and optimize the algorithm. 
									Despite the effectiveness of the tool, the repetitive nature of the tasks started to blend together, becoming mundane. This led me to search for new challenges within the company, but unfortunately, my internal efforts were unsuccessful, prompting me to explore opportunities elsewhere, ultimately leading me to SLB.
									</br>
									</br>
									What truly attracted me to SLB was the abundance of growth opportunities, offering a chance to gain knowledge in various aspects of the company. I joined SLB's Managed Pressure Drilling team, focusing on New Product Development. The role was exhilarating, involving the design of novel products and engagement in research and development. However, the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a major restructuring within SLB, resulting in my transition to the sustaining team.
									The great part of sustaining is that the tasks are very dynamic and challenging. AAfter the transition, I embarked on a failure investigation for one of our clients, a unique occurrence we had not encountered before. I was selected to perform the root cause analysis, which involved taking measurements, analyzing test data using Excel, conducting visual inspections, and determining the root cause while proposing a solution. 
									To implement the solution, I designed the required components, conducted numerous tests, and performed data analyses incorporating testing data, finite element analysis, and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis. It was during this time that I truly recognized my passion for data analysis and comprehended its criticality in engineering and business decision-making. The issue we face was excel and our laptop did not have the capability
									of handling the large datasets and it would keep crashing, at times it would even corrupt the file. This caused delays and extended our reporting and analysis time. To combat this, I created a Jupyter Notebook using Python code to automate the analysis and eliminate the processing power issue with excel.
									As a result, I realized my passion for coding and creating automated tools to facilitate data analysis.
									</br>
									</br>
									<h3 class="left">Path forward</h3>
									Driven by my newfound passion for data, I am continuously eager to expand my knowledge and skills. In my personal time, I actively engage in learning endeavors focused on enhancing my coding proficiency, statistical analysis capabilities, and proficiency in conducting case studies. Each day presents an opportunity for me to delve deeper into these subjects and further refine my expertise with case studies.
									Looking ahead, I am thrilled to embark on a master's degree journey, which will provide a more structured and comprehensive education. My aim is to specialize as a machine learning engineer, dedicating myself to the advancement of this field. Ultimately, my goal is to develop an AI/ML tool that automates processes or analyses, thereby enhancing business objectives and aligning them with data-driven goals.
